# iStock

## Description

iStock is a web application that allows you to search and follow companies in the stock market. The user can create a favourites list, and track their performance day to day.

## User stories (MVP)

**404** - As a user I want to see a nice 404 page when I go to a page that doesnâ€™t exist so that I know it was my fault

**500** - As a user I want to see a nice error page when the super team screws it up so that I know that is not my fault

The application will have 3 sections: Homepage, Profile and My list

1. **Homepage** - As a user I want to be able to access the homepage so that I can see a list of the companies as well as the last traded stock price. Every company has a button to add to your favourites list. If you're not logged in and you try to add a company to the list, the page will redirect you to the **Log in** page.
2. **Log in** - As a user I want to be able to log in on the webpage so that I can see my list of companies. If I'm not signed up, I can click a button that will redirect me to the **Sign up** page
3. **Sign up** - As a user I want to sign up on the webpage so that I can add companies to my list and see the list.
4. **Log out** - As a user I want to be able to log out from the webpage so that I can make sure no one will access my account.
5. **My list of companies** - As a user I want to be able to see my list of favourite companies as well as remove any company that I'm no longer interested in. For every company added, as a user I will be able to adjust the number of shares for every company in my portfolio.

## Backlog / Nice to have

- Connect the application to the Yahoo Finance API to obtain the companies' data including the stock's description, last price and market capitalization
- Include the companies' historic price chart in a thumbnail in the **Home page** and **My list of companies**
